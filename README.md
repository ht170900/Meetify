I was facing issue for mapping/converting IST timezone directly using pytz so, I have changed the timezone in the format Asia/Kolkata. This could be done using mapping as well but the that would be static and can work on few mapping which I will add so added this generic solution.

I have user MySQL database and have provided the curl commands to test these functionalities on local server.

Also requirements and database queries are provided for further live testing and configurations.
